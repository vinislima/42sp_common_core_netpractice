# NetPractice

## Description
This project is a general practical exercise designed to introduce the basics of computer networking. The goal is to learn how to configure IP addresses, connect devices through a router, and understand the role of a gateway within a network. You will configure small-scale networks by completing 10 levels of training exercises.

## Instructions

### How to run the training interface
1.  Download the file attached to the project page.
2.  Extract the files into a folder.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the NetPractice interface.
4.  Enter your intranet login when prompted.

### Execution and Submission
* **Goal:** Complete the 10 levels by modifying the network configuration (IPs, Masks, Gateways) until the goals are met.
* **Export:** Once a level is solved, click the **"Get my config"** button to download the configuration file for that level.
* **Submission:** You must export one configuration file per level (10 files in total).
* **Requirement:** Place the **10 exported configuration files at the root** of your Git repository. Do not rename them.

## Resources

### Networking Concepts
As required, this project involves the study of the following networking concepts:
* TCP/IP addressing
* Subnet mask
* Default gateway
* Routers and switches
* OSI layers

### AI Usage
*Description of AI usage as required by the subject:*

* **Tools used:** Gemini
* **Tasks:** Explanation of general networking concepts.
* **Parts of the project:** I used Gemini to get clear explanations of theoretical concepts such as TCP/IP addressing and subnet masks to better understand the logic needed to solve the levels.
* **Verification:** I have verified the AI-generated information by applying the concepts directly in the NetPractice training interface and checking if the solutions worked.
